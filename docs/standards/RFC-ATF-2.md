      RFC-ATF-2: Agent Trust Fabric — Runtime Governance Continuity
      Extension to RFC-ATF-1 · Version 1.0.0 · OMNIX QUANTUM Open Standard


Abstract

   This document specifies the Runtime Governance Continuity (RGC)
   extension to the Agent Trust Fabric (ATF) delegation protocol defined
   in RFC-ATF-1.  RFC-ATF-1 established the cryptographic foundation for
   verifiable agent authority delegation at the point of admission.
   RFC-ATF-2 extends that foundation to cover the full execution
   lifecycle of long-running autonomous agent workflows.

   The foundational problem this extension addresses is structural: in
   multi-agent systems, authority can become invalid mid-execution —
   through temporal expiry, budget exhaustion, context drift, or
   integrity degradation — while admission-time governance remains
   blind to each of these failure modes.  Many systems prove identity
   at admission.  Fewer prove the continuous validity of authority,
   detect mid-flight degradation, enforce budget fragmentation across
   concurrent sub-agents, or support reauthorization without halting
   execution.  This extension formalizes all four.

   The central contribution is the Runtime Continuity Record (RCR) — a
   PQC-signed, TAR-anchored authority health artifact emitted at governed
   intervals throughout agent execution.  A sequence of RCRs forms a
   Continuity Chain: a cryptographic timeline connecting the admission
   event (TAR) to the execution termination event, with authority health
   verifiable at nanosecond-precision execution boundaries throughout
   runtime.

   RFC-ATF-2 introduces:

   (1) The Continuity Eligibility Score (CES) — a composite, weighted,
       real-time metric quantifying the runtime health of an agent's
       authorization across four dimensions: temporal validity, authority
       budget consumption, contextual fidelity, and integrity signal.

   (2) The Authority Fragmentation Guard (AFG) — a protocol enforcing
       aggregate budget constraints across concurrent sub-agents sharing
       a delegation chain root, closing an attack vector that individual-
       level Monotonic Authority Reduction (RFC-ATF-1, §7.1) cannot
       detect.

   (3) The Escalation Protocol — a structured, threshold-triggered
       response framework that issues signed Continuity Escalation Events
       (CEEs) and, at CRITICAL threshold, formal Reauthorization
       Challenges (RCs) requiring Tier-1 response.

   (4) Eight new invariants (RGC-INV-001 through RGC-INV-008) that are
       formally model-checkable and extend the six invariants of
       RFC-ATF-1.

   An implementation that complies with both RFC-ATF-1 and RFC-ATF-2 is
   designated ATF-RGC-Compliant.

1.  Introduction

   RFC-ATF-1 defined a complete protocol for cryptographic agent-to-agent
   authority delegation.  At its core, RFC-ATF-1 enables any party to
   verify, without platform access, that an autonomous agent possessed a
   specific, bounded, human-originated grant of authority at the moment
   its execution was admitted.

   This is admission-time governance: a point-in-time proof.

   Admission-time governance is necessary but structurally insufficient
   for long-running agent executions.  Consider a workflow that runs for
   ninety minutes.  RFC-ATF-1 (extended by Temporal Authority, ADR-157)
   provides proof that the delegating authority was valid when the
   workflow was admitted — second zero.  But it cannot answer:

      "At minute forty-seven, when the agent committed the transaction —
      was the authority still valid?  Had the budget been depleted by a
      sibling agent spawned at minute twelve?  Had the scope drifted
      beyond the operational context for which the authority was granted?
      Were there active anomalies on the delegation chain that should
      have triggered a restriction?"

   These are not theoretical concerns.  In multi-agent systems, authority
   can become invalid mid-execution in four structurally distinct ways:

   (a) Temporal expiry — the Delegation Receipt expires before the
       execution completes.

   (b) Budget exhaustion — the authority budget is consumed, in whole or
       in part by concurrent sub-agents, below a safe operational level.

   (c) Context drift — the operational context for which authority was
       granted diverges from the actual context of execution, rendering
       the original scope defensibility void.

   (d) Integrity degradation — governance anomalies accumulate on the
       delegation chain, signaling environmental compromise.

   None of these conditions are detectable by RFC-ATF-1 alone.
   Governance frameworks that rely solely on admission-time verification
   leave the ongoing validity of authority as an assumption — trusted
   implicitly from admission to completion.

   RFC-ATF-2 closes this gap.


2.  Problem Statement: The Runtime Governance Gap

   Define the following terms:

   Boundary Attestation (BA):
      Cryptographic proof that a delegation grant was valid at time T0,
      the moment of execution admission.  RFC-ATF-1 + Temporal Authority
      (ADR-157) provide full BA.

   Continuous Governability Supervision (CGS):
      Ongoing verification that the delegation grant remains valid and
      within safe operational parameters at every moment T0 < t < Tf,
      where Tf is the execution completion time.

   The Runtime Governance Gap is defined as:

      Gap = CGS − BA

   An ATF-1-only deployment has Gap > 0 for any execution with Tf > T0,
   i.e., any execution with non-zero duration.  In practice, for
   executions of duration d seconds, the window of unverified authority
   health is exactly d seconds.

   For SHORT executions (d < 60s), the gap is operationally tolerable.
   For MEDIUM (60s–600s) and LONG (> 600s) executions, and especially
   for STREAMING (unbounded) executions, the gap represents a structural
   governance failure under regulatory frameworks requiring continuous
   monitoring (EU AI Act Art. 9, DORA Art. 9, NIST AI RMF Govern 1.4).

   RFC-ATF-2 closes the gap by establishing CGS as a first-class
   protocol concern.


3.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
   in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174].

   This document uses all terms defined in RFC-ATF-1 §2 without
   redefinition.  Additional terms introduced by this extension:

   Runtime Continuity Record (RCR):
      A PQC-signed, immutable authority health snapshot for a specific
      agent execution, captured at a governed sampling boundary.
      Identified by ATFRCR-{16HEX}.

   Continuity Eligibility Score (CES):
      A composite real number in [0.0, 100.0] representing the runtime
      health of an agent's authorization at the moment of an RCR.
      Computed from four weighted components: T (temporal), B (budget),
      D (context fidelity), I (integrity).

   Continuity Chain:
      The ordered, acyclic sequence of RCRs for a single execution
      session, linked via predecessor_rcr_id, anchored at one end to
      the admission TAR and at the other to the terminal RCR.

   Continuity Session:
      The in-engine tracking state for a single long-running execution,
      keyed by the admission TAR identifier.

   Continuity Escalation Event (CEE):
      A signed, immutable artifact emitted when CES crosses a threshold
      boundary, carrying the threshold crossed, the recommended action,
      and a response TTL.  Identified by ATFCEE-{16HEX}.

   Reauthorization Challenge (RC):
      A signed formal request for mid-execution authority renewal,
      issued to the Tier-1 authority when CES drops to CRITICAL.
      Identified by ATFRC-{16HEX}.

   Authority Fragmentation Guard (AFG):
      A protocol enforcing that the aggregate authority budget across all
      active Continuity Sessions sharing a chain_root_id does not exceed
      a configurable fraction of the chain root budget.

   Fragmentation Score:
      The aggregate budget consumption percentage across all active
      sessions on a chain root, reported in each RCR as a real number
      in [0.0, 100.0].

   CES Threshold Level:
      One of five ordered status values derived from CES:
      NOMINAL, MONITORING, WARNING, CRITICAL, HALT.

   Temporal Health (T):
      The T-component of CES: time remaining on the source DR as a
      fraction of its total authorized lifetime, expressed as [0, 100].

   Budget Health (B):
      The B-component of CES: authority budget remaining as a fraction
      of the budget at admission, expressed as [0, 100].

   Context Fidelity (D):
      The D-component of CES: 100 minus the context drift percentage
      reported by the Scope Authorization Engine (ADR-147).

   Integrity Score (I):
      The I-component of CES: 100 minus ten times the count of active
      governance anomalies on the delegation chain.

   TAR:
      Temporal Admissibility Record — the admission anchor for an RCR
      chain (defined in ATF Extension: Temporal Authority, ADR-157).

   AFG Limit:
      The maximum fraction of chain root budget permitted across all
      active sub-delegations.  Default: 0.90.  Configurable via
      AFG_FRAGMENTATION_LIMIT environment variable.


4.  Architecture: RGC Layer

4.1.  Position in the ATF Stack

   RFC-ATF-2 adds a fourth operational layer to the three-layer ATF
   architecture defined in RFC-ATF-1 §3:

   Layer 1 — Identity Plane (RFC-ATF-1 §4):
      Agent Identity Records.

   Layer 2 — Delegation Plane (RFC-ATF-1 §5):
      Delegation Receipts and Trust Lattice.

   Layer 3 — Verification Plane (RFC-ATF-1 §8):
      Independent, offline receipt verification.

   Layer 4 — Runtime Continuity Plane (RFC-ATF-2):
      Continuous authority health monitoring, escalation, and
      reauthorization throughout execution lifecycle.

   Layer 4 is non-destructive with respect to Layers 1–3: it reads from
   but does not modify the Delegation Plane.  A Layer 4 failure MUST NOT
   prevent a Layer 3 verification from completing.

4.2.  Session Lifecycle

   A Continuity Session has the following lifecycle:

   ADMITTED:
      start_session() called by the execution engine, anchored to a
      validated TAR.  Initial CES is computed from real-time inputs.

   ACTIVE:
      session.status = "ACTIVE".  RCRs emitted at governed intervals.
      CES monitored continuously.

   MONITORING / WARNING / CRITICAL:
      CES has crossed a threshold.  Escalation protocol active.

   HALTED:
      session.status = "HALTED".  Triggered by CES < 10 or RC TTL
      expiry.  Terminal RCR issued.  Sibling sessions on the same
      chain root receive revocation signal.

   STOPPED:
      session.status = "STOPPED".  Normal execution completion.
      Terminal RCR issued with sample_reason = "EXECUTION_COMPLETE".

   REVOKED_BY_HALT:
      session.status = "REVOKED_BY_HALT".  Set by the engine on sibling
      sessions when the chain root session enters HALT.

4.3.  Relationship to TAR

   Every RCR MUST carry a tar_id that references a valid TAR in the
   atf_temporal_records table (RGC-INV-001).  The TAR provides:

   (a) The precise nanosecond at which execution was admitted.
   (b) The DR validity proof at T0.
   (c) The baseline against which temporal health (T-component) is
       computed.

   The continuity chain conceptually begins at the TAR and ends at the
   terminal RCR.  An external verifier can reconstruct the complete
   execution governance timeline by joining: TAR + ordered RCR chain.

5.2.  Identifier Format

   RCR identifiers MUST follow the format:

      rcr-id = "ATFRCR-" 16HEXDIG

   where HEXDIG is an uppercase hexadecimal digit (0–9, A–F).

   Example: ATFRCR-3F7A2B1C4D5E6F7A

   Similarly:
      cee-id = "ATFCEE-" 16HEXDIG
      rc-id  = "ATFRC-"  16HEXDIG

5.3.  Content Hash Construction

   The content hash is computed as:

      payload  = { all RCR fields } - { content_hash, pqc_signature,
                                        pqc_algorithm }
      serialized = JSON.stringify(payload, sort_keys=True, default=str)
      content_hash = hex(SHA-256(UTF-8(serialized)))

   Implementations MUST sort all JSON object keys alphabetically before
   hashing.  Floating-point values MUST be serialized with full precision.

5.4.  PQC Signature

   When a PQC signing provider is available, the engine MUST sign the
   content_hash using ML-DSA-65 (Dilithium-3, FIPS 204) with the
   platform private key.  The signature MUST be base64-encoded.

   If the signing provider is unavailable, the engine MAY issue the RCR
   with pqc_signature = null and MUST log a WARNING.  A content hash is
   always computed regardless of signature availability.

5.5.  Immutability (RGC-INV-005)

   An RCR is immutable once issued.  Implementations MUST NOT provide an
   UPDATE path for RCR records.  The persistence schema MUST use
   INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING, never INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO
   UPDATE.


6.  Continuity Eligibility Score (CES)

6.1.  Formula

   CES is computed as a weighted sum of four components:

      CES = (T × 0.30) + (B × 0.30) + (D × 0.20) + (I × 0.20)

   CES is a real number in [0.0, 100.0].

6.2.  Component Definitions

   T — Temporal Health (weight 0.30):

      If dr_expires_at is null:
         T = 100.0

      Else:
         total_lifetime_ns = dr_expires_at_ns − dr_issued_ns
         remaining_ns      = dr_expires_at_ns − now_ns

         If total_lifetime_ns ≤ 0 or remaining_ns ≤ 0:
            T = 0.0
         Else:
            T = max(0.0, min(100.0, remaining_ns / total_lifetime_ns × 100))

   B — Budget Health (weight 0.30):

      If budget_at_admission = 0:
         B = 100.0
      Else:
         B = max(0.0, min(100.0, budget_remaining / budget_at_admission × 100))

   D — Context Fidelity (weight 0.20):

      D = max(0.0, min(100.0, 100.0 − context_drift_pct))

      context_drift_pct is sourced from the Scope Authorization Engine
      (ADR-147).  If the scope engine is unavailable, implementations
      SHOULD use context_drift_pct = 0.0 and log a WARNING.

   I — Integrity Score (weight 0.20):

      I = max(0.0, min(100.0, 100.0 − (active_anomalies × 10)))

      Each active governance anomaly on the delegation chain reduces
      I by 10 points.  At 10 or more anomalies, I = 0.0.

6.3.  Threshold Levels

   CES thresholds and their governance implications:

   ┌────────────────┬──────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ CES Range      │ Status       │ Required Engine Action                            │

   └────────────────┴──────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

   Threshold boundary: NOMINAL begins at CES ≥ 75.0.  A CES of exactly
   75.0 is NOMINAL; a CES of 74.999... is MONITORING.

6.4.  Computation Requirements (RGC-INV-002)

   CES MUST be computed from real-time values at the nanosecond of the
   RCR.  Implementations MUST NOT:

   (a) Cache any CES component across samples.
   (b) Use a CES value computed at a previous sample for the current RCR.
   (c) Apply smoothing, averaging, or interpolation to CES components.

   Cached or stale inputs MUST raise InvalidCESInputError.


7.  Continuity Chain

7.1.  Chain Structure

   The continuity chain is a singly linked list of RCRs:

      TAR (admission anchor)
       └── RCR₁  (predecessor_rcr_id = null)
            └── RCR₂  (predecessor_rcr_id = RCR₁.rcr_id)
                 └── RCR₃  (predecessor_rcr_id = RCR₂.rcr_id)
                      └── ...
                           └── RCRₙ  (terminal — sample_reason = EXECUTION_COMPLETE
                                       or HALT)

7.2.  Acyclicity (RGC-INV-006)

   The continuity chain MUST be acyclic.  Implementations enforce this
   by requiring:

      For every RCR pair (RCRᵢ, RCRⱼ) in a session where j > i:
         RCRⱼ.execution_ns > RCRᵢ.execution_ns

   Implementations MUST detect and reject any attempt to insert an RCR
   with execution_ns ≤ the session's last_rcr_ns.  If clock skew
   produces this condition, the engine MUST advance execution_ns to
   last_rcr_ns + 1.

7.3.  TAR Anchoring (RGC-INV-001)

   Every RCR MUST carry a tar_id referencing a valid entry in the
   atf_temporal_records table.  An RCR with tar_id = null or tar_id
   referencing a non-existent record MUST be rejected.

7.4.  Chain Verification

   To verify a continuity chain, a verifier MUST:

   1. Retrieve all RCRs for a session ordered by execution_ns ascending.
   2. Verify each RCR's content_hash independently (§5.3).
   3. Verify each RCR's pqc_signature where present.
   4. Confirm that RCR₁.predecessor_rcr_id = null.
   5. Confirm that for every pair (RCRᵢ, RCRᵢ₊₁):
         RCRᵢ₊₁.predecessor_rcr_id = RCRᵢ.rcr_id
         RCRᵢ₊₁.execution_ns > RCRᵢ.execution_ns
   6. Confirm that every RCR.tar_id is identical (single session anchor).
   7. Recompute CES from stored component values and verify consistency
      with stored ces_score.


8.  Authority Fragmentation Guard (AFG)

8.1.  The Fragmentation Attack

   Consider a Delegation Receipt DR with authority_budget_granted = 60.
   The Monotonic Authority Reduction invariant (RFC-ATF-1 §7.1) prevents
   any single sub-delegation from exceeding 60.  However, an agent may
   spawn N concurrent sub-agents, each with a grant of 60 / N.
   Individually, each sub-delegation satisfies MAR.  Collectively, the
   sub-agents exercise a combined budget of 60 from a root grant of 60,
   exhausting the budget across the distribution.

   If instead the attacker spawns (N+k) agents, each receiving a grant
   that individually satisfies MAR, the aggregate budget consumption
   exceeds the chain root budget by a factor proportional to k.  This
   is the authority fragmentation attack.

   RFC-ATF-1 MAR cannot detect this because it operates per-receipt,
   not per-chain.  AFG closes this gap by operating at the chain level.

8.2.  AFG Protocol

   The AFG MUST be checked before any new sub-delegation is admitted
   into a Continuity Session:

      aggregate_consumed = Σ budget_at_admission
                           for all ACTIVE sessions on chain_root_id

      proposed_aggregate = aggregate_consumed + new_grant_budget

      AFG_LIMIT = chain_root_budget × AFG_FRAGMENTATION_LIMIT

      If proposed_aggregate > AFG_LIMIT:
         Raise AuthorityFragmentationViolation (RGC-INV-004)
         Reject the new sub-delegation

   The default AFG_FRAGMENTATION_LIMIT is 0.90 (90%).  The remaining
   10% serves as a continuity buffer — it cannot be delegated but
   provides a residual authority reserve for recovery operations.

   Implementations MAY configure AFG_FRAGMENTATION_LIMIT via the
   AFG_FRAGMENTATION_LIMIT environment variable.  Values above 0.95
   are NOT RECOMMENDED.  Values above 1.0 MUST NOT be accepted.

8.3.  Fragmentation Score

   Each RCR MUST carry a fragmentation_score field:

      fragmentation_score = (aggregate_consumed_at_sample /
                             total_budget_at_admission) × 100

   A fragmentation_score of 0 indicates no concurrent sub-agents.
   A fragmentation_score approaching 90 indicates proximity to the AFG
   limit and warrants operator attention.

8.4.  AFG Invariant (RGC-INV-004)

   RGC-INV-004: The aggregate authority budget across all ACTIVE
   Continuity Sessions sharing a chain_root_id MUST NOT exceed
   chain_root_budget × AFG_FRAGMENTATION_LIMIT.

   Violation raises AuthorityFragmentationViolation.  Existing sessions
   are not terminated by a violation — only the new sub-delegation is
   rejected.


9.  Escalation Protocol

9.1.  Continuity Escalation Event (CEE)

   A Continuity Escalation Event (CEE) MUST be issued whenever CES
   transitions to a status other than NOMINAL.  The CEE is signed
   (ML-DSA-65) and persisted to atf_continuity_escalations.

9.2.  Threshold-to-Action Mapping

   ┌────────────────┬──────────────────────┬────────────────────────┐
   │ Status         │ Recommended Action   │ RC Issued?             │
   ├────────────────┼──────────────────────┼────────────────────────┤
   │ MONITORING     │ ALERT                │ No                     │
   │ WARNING        │ SUSPEND_SPAWNING     │ No                     │
   │ CRITICAL       │ REAUTHORIZE          │ Yes — ATFRC-{16HEX}    │
   │ HALT           │ HALT                 │ No (immediate HALT)    │
   └────────────────┴──────────────────────┴────────────────────────┘

9.3.  Escalation Event Format

   A CEE MUST contain:

   cee_id (string):           ATFCEE-{16HEX}
   rcr_id (string):           The triggering RCR
   tar_id (string):           Session anchor
   delegation_id (string):    Source DR
   agent_id (string):         Executing agent
   chain_root_id (string):    Chain root
   threshold_crossed (string): MONITORING / WARNING / CRITICAL / HALT
   recommended_action (string): ALERT / SUSPEND_SPAWNING / REAUTHORIZE / HALT
   ces_at_escalation (float): CES value that triggered the CEE
   escalation_ns (integer):   Nanosecond of escalation
   response_ttl_seconds (int): 0 for HALT, implementation-defined for others
   content_hash (string):     SHA-256 of CEE fields (excl. sig fields)
   pqc_signature (string?):   Dilithium-3 signature over content_hash
   issued_at (string):        ISO UTC of CEE issuance


10.  Reauthorization Challenge (RC)

10.1.  Protocol Overview

   A Reauthorization Challenge is a formal, cryptographically signed
   request for mid-execution authority renewal.  It is issued exactly
   when and only when CES drops to CRITICAL (CES ∈ [10, 25)).

   The RC is directed to the Tier-1 authority (human operator or
   Tier-1 agent) that issued the chain root DR.  The Tier-1 authority
   responds by issuing a new, short-lifetime Delegation Receipt bearing
   the rc_id in its metadata.

   A single open RC per session is maintained.  If CES remains CRITICAL
   across multiple samples while an unresolved, unexpired RC exists,
   the engine MUST NOT issue a duplicate RC.

10.2.  RC Format

   An RC MUST contain:

   rc_id (string):            ATFRC-{16HEX}
   cee_id (string):           The CEE that triggered this RC
   tar_id (string):           Session anchor
   delegation_id (string):    DR being challenged
   agent_id (string):         Executing agent
   chain_root_id (string):    Chain root
   ces_at_challenge (float):  CES at time of RC issuance
   challenge_ns (integer):    Nanosecond of RC issuance
   ttl_seconds (integer):     Time allowed for Tier-1 response
   expires_at_ns (integer):   challenge_ns + (ttl_seconds × 10⁹)
   response_dr_id (string?):  New DR ID when resolved
   resolved (boolean):        False until Tier-1 responds or TTL expires
   resolution (string?):      "REAUTHORIZED" or "EXPIRED"
   content_hash (string):     SHA-256 of RC fields (excl. sig fields)
   pqc_signature (string?):   Dilithium-3 signature over content_hash
   issued_at (string):        ISO UTC of RC issuance

10.3.  Challenge-Response Sequence

   The complete Reauthorization Challenge protocol proceeds as follows:

   Step 1: Engine detects CES ∈ [10, 25) at sample time Tₛ.
   Step 2: Engine issues CEE with threshold_crossed = CRITICAL.
   Step 3: Engine issues RC (ATFRC-{16HEX}) with:
              expires_at_ns = Tₛ + (ttl_seconds × 10⁹)
   Step 4: RC is delivered to the designated Tier-1 escalation endpoint.

   On successful reauthorization:
   Step 5: Tier-1 issues new short-lifetime DR (DR') carrying
              metadata.rc_id = rc_id
   Step 6: Engine validates DR':
              (a) DR' authority_budget_granted ≤ original DR budget
              (b) DR' issued by a valid Tier-1 principal
              (c) DR' expires_at is after current time
   Step 7: If valid, engine resolves RC:
              rc.resolved = true, rc.resolution = "REAUTHORIZED"
   Step 8: Engine resets T-component: session.dr_expires_at_ns updated
              to DR'.expires_at_ns
   Step 9: Next RCR shows refreshed CES with restored T-component.

   On TTL expiry without response:
   Step 5: Engine detects rc.is_expired() = true.
   Step 6: Engine issues terminal HALT RCR (§10.5).

10.4.  TTL Enforcement (RGC-INV-008)

   Implementations MUST enforce RC TTL with nanosecond-precision
   comparison:

      is_expired = (time.time_ns() > rc.expires_at_ns) AND NOT rc.resolved

   Implementations SHOULD check RC TTL at every sample event.
   Implementations MAY run a background thread that checks TTL
   at a configurable interval (default: 60 seconds).

10.5.  Auto-HALT on Expiry (RGC-INV-003 + RGC-INV-008)

   When RC TTL expires without response, the engine MUST:

   1. Issue a terminal RCR with:
         continuity_status = HALT
         sample_reason = RC_TTL_EXPIRED
         metadata.rc_id = rc.rc_id
         metadata.halt_reason = "RC_TTL_EXPIRED"
   2. Set session.status = HALTED.
   3. Issue REVOKED_BY_HALT to all sibling sessions on the same
      chain_root_id (§12, RGC-INV-003).
   4. Invoke the halt_callback if registered.


11.  Sampling Strategy

11.1.  Execution Profiles

   Implementations SHOULD classify executions into profiles:

      SHORT:     Duration < 60 seconds
      MEDIUM:    60 ≤ duration < 600 seconds
      LONG:      Duration ≥ 600 seconds
      STREAMING: Unbounded duration (no expected termination)

11.2.  Sampling Intervals

   Recommended sampling intervals by profile and CES status:

   ┌────────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────────┬──────────────────┐
   │ Profile        │ NOMINAL (s)  │ MONITORING (s)   │ CRITICAL (s)     │
   ├────────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────────┼──────────────────┤
   │ SHORT          │ None         │ 15               │ 5                │
   │ MEDIUM         │ 60           │ 30               │ 10               │
   │ LONG           │ 120          │ 60               │ 20               │
   │ STREAMING      │ 30           │ 15               │ 5                │
   └────────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────────┴──────────────────┘

   Configurable via RGC_SAMPLE_INTERVAL_SECONDS environment variable.
   WARNING status sampling SHOULD use MONITORING intervals.

11.3.  Manual Sampling

   Any party with access to the engine MAY trigger a manual RCR at any
   time by calling sample() with sample_reason = EXTERNAL.  Manual
   samples do not reset the automatic sampling clock.


12.  RGC Invariants

   This section specifies all eight invariants of RFC-ATF-2.  Each
   invariant MUST be enforced by any ATF-RGC-Compliant implementation.

   RGC-INV-001: TAR Anchoring
      Every RCR MUST carry a tar_id referencing a valid, non-null
      Temporal Admissibility Record.  Enforcement: tar_id NOT NULL,
      validated against atf_temporal_records at session start.

   RGC-INV-002: Real-Time CES Computation
      CES MUST be computed exclusively from values current at the
      nanosecond of the RCR.  Cached, averaged, or stale inputs MUST
      raise InvalidCESInputError.

   RGC-INV-003: HALT Propagation
      When a session enters HALT status, all ACTIVE sessions sharing
      the same chain_root_id MUST receive status = REVOKED_BY_HALT.
      The halt_callback, if registered, MUST be invoked.

   RGC-INV-004: Authority Fragmentation Guard
      The aggregate authority budget across all ACTIVE sessions sharing
      a chain_root_id MUST NOT exceed chain_root_budget × AFG_LIMIT.
      Violation raises AuthorityFragmentationViolation.

   RGC-INV-005: RCR Immutability
      An RCR MUST NOT be modified after issuance.  Persistence MUST use
      INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING.  No UPDATE path is permitted.

   RGC-INV-006: Chain Acyclicity
      The continuity chain MUST be acyclic.  Each RCR's execution_ns
      MUST be strictly greater than its predecessor's execution_ns.

   RGC-INV-007: CES Input Freshness
      CES inputs MUST not exceed the following staleness thresholds:
      5 seconds for CRITICAL sessions, 30 seconds for NOMINAL sessions.
      Stale inputs MUST raise InvalidCESInputError.

   RGC-INV-008: RC TTL Enforcement
      A Reauthorization Challenge TTL MUST be enforced with nanosecond
      precision.  Auto-HALT MUST be triggered on expiry without response.

   All eight invariants extend (but do not replace) the six invariants
   of RFC-ATF-1.  An ATF-RGC-Compliant implementation satisfies all
   fourteen invariants (ATF-INV-001–006 + RGC-INV-001–008).

14.  Verification Protocol

14.1.  Single RCR Verification

   To verify a single RCR, a verifier MUST:

   1. Recompute content_hash from the RCR payload per §5.3.
   2. Assert computed hash = rcr.content_hash.
   3. If pqc_signature is present, verify the signature against the
      platform public key using ML-DSA-65.
   4. Recompute CES from stored component values and assert
      ces_score = (ces_temporal × 0.30) + (ces_budget × 0.30) +
                  (ces_context × 0.20) + (ces_integrity × 0.20).
   5. Assert continuity_status is consistent with ces_score per §6.3.

14.2.  Continuity Chain Verification

   A chain verification MUST additionally:

   6. Assert RCR₁.predecessor_rcr_id = null.
   7. For every (RCRᵢ, RCRᵢ₊₁) pair: assert predecessor linkage correct.
   8. Assert execution_ns is strictly increasing.
   9. Assert all RCRs carry identical tar_id.

14.3.  Independent Offline Verification

   RFC-ATF-2 preserves ATF-INV-006 (RFC-ATF-1 §7.6): all verification
   MUST be performable without platform access.  An offline verifier
   requires only:

   (a) The RCR (or chain) to be verified.
   (b) The platform's Dilithium-3 public key.
   (c) The SHA-256 and ML-DSA-65 implementations.

   No API access, no account, no online connectivity required.

17.  Security Considerations

17.1.  CES Manipulation

   An attacker with control over CES inputs may attempt to keep CES
   artificially high to avoid escalation.  Mitigations:

   (a) Context drift input MUST come from an independent Scope
       Authorization Engine, not from the executing agent itself.
   (b) Active anomaly count MUST be sourced from an independent
       governance monitoring layer.
   (c) Temporal and budget components are computed by the engine from
       session state — not from agent-reported values.
   (d) RGC-INV-002 prohibits cached inputs.

17.2.  Chain Replay Attack

   An attacker may attempt to replay an old, high-CES RCR to misrepresent
   the current authority health of an execution.  Mitigations:

   (a) Each RCR carries execution_ns — an external verifier can detect
       temporal anomalies.
   (b) The continuity chain is acyclic (RGC-INV-006) — inserted RCRs
       would break the chain linkage.
   (c) PQC signature verification detects tampered or replayed RCRs.

17.3.  Fragmentation Attack

   Addressed by the AFG protocol (§8).  Implementations MUST enforce
   the AFG check before every new sub-delegation.

17.4.  Clock Drift Attack

   An attacker who can manipulate the system clock may produce RCRs
   with artificially high T-component values.  Implementations SHOULD
   use a monotonic clock source for execution_ns.  Implementations MAY
   additionally validate execution_ns against an external time authority.

17.5.  RC Forgery

   An attacker may attempt to forge an RC response by submitting a DR
   that does not originate from a valid Tier-1 principal.  The engine
   MUST validate the response DR against the Trust Lattice before
   accepting a reauthorization.

17.6.  Phantom HALT

   An attacker with write access to the anomaly count (active_anomalies)
   input may manufacture artificial HALTs by inflating the anomaly count.
   The anomaly source MUST be access-controlled and sourced from the
   independent governance monitoring layer.

17.7.  Budget Inflation Attack

   An attacker may attempt to report a higher budget_remaining than
   actual to keep B-component high.  The engine computes budget_remaining
   from its own session state (updated by budget_consumed inputs at each
   sample), not from agent-reported values.

19.  Extension Points

   Implementations MAY extend RFC-ATF-2 with the following:

   RCR → W3C Verifiable Credential Export:
      Export RCR chains as W3C Verifiable Presentations for cross-
      organizational governance verification without ATF infrastructure.

   Predictive CES:
      An ML model trained on historical CES trajectories to predict
      CRITICAL events 60–120 seconds before threshold crossing,
      enabling proactive reauthorization.

   Multi-Instance Synchronization:
      Synchronize the fragmentation guard across horizontally scaled
      instances via a distributed state broadcast (e.g., Redis pub/sub),
      ensuring AFG accuracy in multi-replica deployments.

   RCR Streaming:
      Real-time streaming of RCRs to external SIEM or governance
      monitoring platforms via webhook or message queue.

   Cross-Organization Continuity Verification:
      Protocol for verifying continuity chains across organizational
      boundaries where the verifying party does not have access to the
      issuing platform's internal state.


20.  Relationship to RFC-ATF-1

   RFC-ATF-2 is a strict extension of RFC-ATF-1.  All RFC-ATF-1 artifacts
   (AIR, DR, Trust Lattice, TAR) remain normative and unchanged.  RFC-ATF-2
   adds Layer 4 without modifying Layers 1–3.

   Compliance levels:

   ATF-Compliant:
      Implements RFC-ATF-1 in full (all six invariants, DR issuance,
      PQC signing, offline verification).

   ATF-Temporal-Compliant:
      Additionally implements Temporal Authority Admissibility (ADR-157):
      TAR issuance, nanosecond-precise admission proofs.

   ATF-RGC-Compliant:
      Additionally implements RFC-ATF-2 in full (all eight RGC invariants,
      RCR issuance, CES computation, AFG, escalation protocol, RC
      protocol, offline chain verification).

   An implementation that is ATF-RGC-Compliant satisfies all fourteen
   invariants across both documents and provides full lifecycle governance
   coverage from agent registration through execution completion.

   Inputs:
      dr_expires_at     = null
      budget_remaining  = 80.0
      budget_admission  = 80.0
      context_drift_pct = 0.0
      active_anomalies  = 0

   T = 100.0
   B = 80.0 / 80.0 × 100 = 100.0
   D = 100.0 - 0.0 = 100.0
   I = 100.0 - 0 × 10 = 100.0

   CES = (100.0 × 0.30) + (100.0 × 0.30) + (100.0 × 0.20) + (100.0 × 0.20)
       = 30.0 + 30.0 + 20.0 + 20.0 = 100.0 — NOMINAL

A.2.  CRITICAL Session — DR Nearing Expiry, Budget Drained

   Inputs:
      time_remaining_ns = 300_000_000_000 (5 minutes)
      total_lifetime_ns = 7_200_000_000_000 (2 hours)
      budget_remaining  = 8.0
      budget_admission  = 80.0
      context_drift_pct = 30.0
      active_anomalies  = 2

   T = 300_000_000_000 / 7_200_000_000_000 × 100 = 4.17
   B = 8.0 / 80.0 × 100 = 10.0
   D = 100.0 - 30.0 = 70.0
   I = 100.0 - 2 × 10 = 80.0

   CES = (4.17 × 0.30) + (10.0 × 0.30) + (70.0 × 0.20) + (80.0 × 0.20)
       = 1.25 + 3.0 + 14.0 + 16.0 = 34.25 — WARNING

      B = 0.0   (budget exhausted)
      D = 0.0   (100% context drift)
      I = 0.0   (10+ anomalies)

   CES = 0.0 — HALT

24.  Appendix C — Implementation Notes

   Reference implementation: omnix_core/agents/atf/runtime_continuity.py
   Test suite: tests/test_runtime_governance_continuity.py (82 tests)
   Verification status: 82/82 passing as of May 13, 2026

   The reference implementation is structured as a process-level singleton
   (get_rgc_engine()) to ensure a single, consistent fragmentation guard
   state within a process.  Deployments with multiple processes MUST
   implement a distributed fragmentation guard (see §19, Extension Points).

   The reference implementation writes to the database via daemon threads
   (non-blocking on the execution path).  The execution path is never
   blocked by DB write failures.  DB failures are logged as WARNING.

   Persistence failures do NOT affect in-memory session state.  RCRs are
   stored in both the in-memory store and the database.  The in-memory
   store is the authoritative source for active sessions.
